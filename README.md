# Mapping_Earthquakes

### An Interactive Earthquake Map 
### with JavaScript and Leaflet

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop an interactive map that displays earthquake information stored as a JSON file, providing viewers with a data-driven story to follow seismic activity.
The script uses a mapbox API key that is stored in a hidden config file, and includes toggle options for street, satelite, and dark view.
